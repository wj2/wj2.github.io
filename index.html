    <h1>Summary</h1>
    

    <p>I am a postdoctoral research scientist in the Center for Theoretical Neuroscience
at Columbia University. I did my graduate work with David Freedman at The 
University of Chicago. </p>
<p>In my research, I like to think about how the neural code solves problems 
such as: remaining robust in the face of noise (or other disorder), allows for 
generalization across different contexts and between different stimuli, 
represents multiple different stimuli at once without confusing them, and
-- of course -- how it does all of this at once! I believe that the fact that
the brain must often represent multiple stimuli simultaneously is an important 
constraint on the neural code that is understudied in theoretical neuroscience.
As a result, much of my current work is at least obliquely related to this 
topic. </p>
<p>Outside my research, I am very interested in cooperation (living, eating, sharing
resources, etc.), I like to imagine and work toward worlds that are freer and more 
just than the one we have now (or than any world possible under capitalism), I 
like to read and discuss a variety of things (including anarchism 
and poetry), I like to go outside (hiking, backpacking, canoeing, canyoneering,
cross-country skiing), and I like to play tabletop and board games. </p>
