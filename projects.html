    <h2>Reliable neural representations</h2>
<p>I have a broad interest in how the neural code can be made robust to the
widespread response variability (i.e., noise) that exists in the brain.</p>
<h3>Nonlinear mixed selectivity</h3>
<p>With Stephanie Palmer and Dave Freedman, I showed that conjunctive nonlinear
mixed selectivity produces metabolically efficient and reliably decoded
neural representations. That is, having single
neurons that code for particular
combinations of stimulus feature values (i.e., a mixed code) produces a
representation of the stimuli that is more robust to noise than a
representation that keeps those stimulus
features separate (i.e., a pure code). In this work, we also outline several
important tradeoffs between mixed codes that combine different numbers of
distinct features, including required
population sizes and optimal receptive field sizes in feature space. </p>
<p>Due to the ubiquity of mixed codes, we believe this description of
their reliability and its tradeoffs will provide important tools that can be
used to understand the nature of representations across many different brain
regions and even different kinds of brains. </p>

<h2>Distributed representation of multiple stimuli</h2>
<p>I am broadly interested in how different brain regions interact with each other
to construct representations of stimuli that are integrated across different
sensory systems and processing streams. I am particularly interested in how
this set of problems is solved in the presence of multiple stimuli, a condition
which is understudied in both laboratory and theoretical settings. I believe
that the
distributed nature of information in the brain and the necessity of
simultaneously representing
variable numbers of stimuli are likely to both constrain neural representations
in interesting ways.</p>
<h3>Solving the assignment problem</h3>
<p>An observer watching a barking dog and purring cat together in a field has
distinct pairs of representations of the two animals in their visual and
auditory systems. Without prior knowledge, how does the observer infer that the
dog barks and the cat purrs? This binding of disparate representations is called
the assignment problem, and it must be solved to integrate distinct
representations across but also within sensory modalities. In this project, I
identify and analyze a solution to the assignment problem: the representation of
one or more
common stimulus features in pairs of relevant brain regions â€“- for example,
estimates of the spatial position of both the cat and the dog represented in
both the visual and auditory systems. Using a statistical model, I derive the
assignment error rate as a function of the number of stimuli, the number of
features that define each stimulus, the number of common features, and the mean
squared-error, or distortion, of each stimulus feature when decoded. Using
rate-distortion theory, I derive the number of bits of information necessary to
achieve a particular assignment error rate and level of distortion. The model
reveals two tradeoffs for a fixed number of bits: first, increasing the number of
common features decreases the assignment error rate but increases
distortion -- that is, makes the estimate of each stimulus noisier; second,
representing the common features with different distortion across the two brain
regions decreases distortion across all features but increases the assignment error
rate. These tradeoffs balance redundancy, which reduces the assignment error rate,
and efficiency, which reduces distortion. Assignment errors reported in humans are
broadly consistent with our model; we also make further, specific predictions that
are yet to be tested.</p>
<p>I am currently preparing a manuscript describing these results.</p>

<h3>Differences in dorsal and ventral stream representations of natural images</h3>
<p>In my experimental work, I have recorded from the inferotemporal cortex (ITC),
a region in the canonical ventral visual stream, and the lateral intraparietal
area (LIP), a region in the canonical dorsal visual stream, during the
performance of three natural image-based behavioral tasks. I am taking multiple
approaches to analyze this rich set of data.</p>
<p>As a first pass, I characterized
the prevalence of single neuron tuning for different task and stimulus factors,
and contrasted how the representation of these factors changes across different
tasks. The results of some of these analyses are shown in the poster below.</p>
