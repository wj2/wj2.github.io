    <h2>Reliable neural representations</h2>
<p>I have a broad interest in how the neural code can be made robust to the
widespread response variability (i.e., noise) that exists in the brain.</p>
<h3>Nonlinear mixed selectivity</h3>
<p>With Stephanie Palmer and Dave Freedman, I showed that conjunctive nonlinear
mixed selectivity produces metabolically efficient and reliably decoded
neural representations. That is, having single
neurons that code for particular
combinations of stimulus feature values (i.e., a mixed code) produces a
representation of the stimuli that is more robust to noise than a
representation that keeps those stimulus
features separate (i.e., a pure code). In this work, we also outline several
important tradeoffs between mixed codes that combine different numbers of
distinct features, including required
population sizes and optimal receptive field sizes in feature space. </p>
<p>Due to the ubiquity of mixed codes, we believe this description of
their reliability and its tradeoffs will provide important tools that can be
used to understand the nature of representations across many different brain
regions and even different kinds of brains. </p>

<h2>Distributed representation of multiple stimuli</h2>
<p>I am broadly interested in how different brain regions interact with each other
to construct representations of stimuli that are integrated across different
sensory systems and processing streams. I am particularly interested in how
this set of problems is solved in the presence of multiple stimuli, a condition
which is understudied in both laboratory and theoretical settings. I believe
that the
distributed nature of information in the brain and the necessity of
simultaneously representing
variable numbers of stimuli are likely to both constrain neural representations
in interesting ways.</p>
<p>I am approaching these questions using both experiments and theory. </p>
