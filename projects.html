<h3>The emergence of abstract representations</h3>
<p>We show that training feedforward neural networks to perform multiple tasks
(here, linear and somewhat nonlinear classifications of a set of latent 
variables) leads to the emergence of representations that provide good 
generalization properties for novel tasks (i.e., abstract representations).  </p>

  trained to perform multiple tasks.

<h3>Robustness in neural codes</h3>
<p>We show that neural representations can be made more reliable by using 
the higher dimensional codes produced by nonlinear mixed selectivity. We 
further show that these benefits hold for reasonable numbers of neurons and 
that nonlinear mixed selectivity is present in the lateral intraparietal area
when it is not necessary to support flexible behavior, but would increase
robustness.  </p>

<h3>Coding difficulties for multiple stimuli</h3>
<p>At a given time, the brain is receiving multiple different kinds of information 
about multiple different objects that are out in the world. How does it make 
sense of it all? </p>
<p>First, animals must bind distinct objects together -- this is referred to as 
the <em>binding problem</em>.
In collaborative work with Justin Fine and Ben Hayden, we argue that the reward 
value associated with offers in a risky gambling task performed by monkeys
is bound to its spatial location through the use of semi-orthogonal subspaces.
In particular, we show that the different neural subspaces used to encode the
value of left and right offers are sufficiently orthogonal to produce reliable 
binding and, later, decoding of offer value. However, we also show that the
subspaces are parallel enough to allow for some generalization of the code for
value from one spatial location to another. We argue that this commonality may 
be important for efficient learning. </p>

  orthogonalization as a mechanism for binding values to space.

</ul>
<p>Next, the animal must integrate across distinct sensory systems -- or distinct
representations of the same set of objects. This is referred to as the 
<em>assignment problem</em>. For exmaple, in the case of integrating sights with 
sounds, both sensory systems develop an estimate of the spatial position of
the source: we show that this redundancy can be used to correctly assign the two 
sets of percepts to each other. We also show how likely it is to fail, and how
changing the amount and kind of overlapping information changes the reliability 
of assignment.  </p>

<li><strong>Johnston WJ</strong>, Freedman DJ (in preparation) Solutions to the assignment problem 
     balance tradeoffs between local and catastrophic errors.  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Directed and undirected tasks</h3>
<p>We compared recordings from the primate lateral intraparietal area (LIP) 
during directed and
undirected visual stimulus selection. While the tasks do sharply differ in 
reward contingencies and training history (the directed task has contingent 
rewards and was learned by extensive training, the undirected task has no 
reward contingency and was not trained), they both center on the same action: 
a saccade selecting a natural image stimulus for overt attention. We show 
that LIP appears to be preferentially involved in the directed task.
This suggests that LIP's role in stimulus selection may be shaped
by training and reward contingency.  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Johnston WJ</strong>, Tetrick SM, Freedman DJ (2022) The lateral 
   intraparietal area is preferentially engaged in directed tasks rather than 
   undirected free behavior.

<h3>Reproducibility</h3>
<p>We attempted to replicate the findings from a sample of 100 previously 
published studies in the psychology literature -- and from this generated an
estimate of the replication rate of psychological science. I performed one of
these replications (with Rebecca Saxe) as a member of the Open Science
Collaboration.   </p>
