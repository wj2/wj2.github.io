<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>I first read the Wild Iris in 2017 on the recommendation of my friend Jane Fentress, which began an ongoing love of Louise Gl√ºck's work. When I first read the book, I felt a vague lack: While I could still understand and feel the beauty of the flowers and plants that are woven into the story, my imagination of them was not very precise. I could not quite remember what clematis was and what chicory was -- or what a daffodil was relative to a daisy (both of these are mistakes I made as recently as a year ago). While this feeling of lack did push me to try to learn more about the relevant plants, I did not take on this project in any more systematic fashion at that time. </p>

<p>In 2020, I reread the Wild Iris in full (I had returned to parts of it previously) as part of a book club with my partner Clara del Junco. Clara and her friend Mathilde Gerbelli-Gauthier had just completed their zine, Burnout, on academic travel. In the conjunction of these two things -- feeling again my lack of knowledge and seeing a zine happen in real time -- the idea for this botanical companion to the Wild Iris was born. </p>

<p>The intended purpose of this zine (I use the term even though it only exists as a collection of webpages at present) is to serve as a companion to readers of the Wild Iris that do not have extensive knowledge of the plants discussed in the text. The zine provides an image of and some basic information about every plant that is mentioned in the book, organized in the same sequence that they appear in the poems and duplicated where there are references to the same plant across multiple poems. I have worked to find images that show the plant in at least some context, though I have not always been successful. The information that I have chosen to present alongside the image is relatively sparse, and chosen to reflect some of the knowledge that a gardener might use in growing the plants. I have not offered any kind of linking interpretation between the characteristics of the plants and their function in the poems. This is left to the reader. </p>

<p>I want to thank Jane Fentress, Eric Potash, Clara del Junco, and many others for advice and encouragement throughout this project. </p>
